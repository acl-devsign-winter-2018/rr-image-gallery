Objective

Build and image gallery that allows a user to view albums created by other users, add images and delete them from those albums. Create a loading and error component for UI. Accomplish this using:
  - redux state management
  - react router
  - redux thunk for async actions
  - responsive design

Steps Taken
===

Start by building reducers and testing them with jest. Build actions. Start with smaller components (image, images) then work upward (album, albums). Use postman to test the api provided. Create functions to store/delete images with the api.
